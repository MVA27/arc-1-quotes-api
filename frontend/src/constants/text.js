    DESC_PARA1: "This project consists of a .NET application which is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance connected to an RDS database within the same VPC. The front-end is a React.js application hosted on Amazon S3. A CI/CD pipeline automates deployment of the applications when code is pushed to GitHub.",
    DESC_PARA2: "The backend API is containerized using Docker and pushed to Docker Hub. AWS services such as EC2, S3, and RDS are used to ensure a scalable and secure architecture, while GitHub Actions facilitates seamless integration and continuous delivery. This approach ensures that the application remains efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain."
